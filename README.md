# Mxdb
Simple, efficient data modeling for Ruby.

### FAQ

### What is Mxdb?

Mxdb adds efficient data modeling, data access, and data testing tools for relational data stored in a database. It is an extension of the API provided by ActiveRecord.

### Is there a trial version?

There's no free trial but we do offer a 14 day period with full refund if it does not work for you.

### What is the license?

See [COMM-LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootedwest/mxdb-support/master/COMM-LICENSE).

### How does licensing work?

Every organization running Mxdb on its own servers must have a license.  There's no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that organization.

### What happens if my subscription lapses?

You must have an active subscription to run Mxdb.  After a one week grace period, you'll lose access to the gem server and priority support.  You won't get any more updates or bug fixes and 'bundle install' won't work anymore.

Mxdb customers paying via invoice have 14 days to pay their bill.

**Please note that pricing can change.**  Once you purchase a subscription, you get that price forever **as long as you continue to pay on time**.  If your subscription expires for non-payment, you will lose that pricing and need to repurchase at current pricing.

### How do I buy Mxdb?

Mxdb is in early-access. Email [info&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:info&#64;rootedwest.com) to request early access.

### Can I distribute Mxdb to my customers?

This is a common requirement for "on-site installs" or "appliances" sold to large corporations.

The standard license is only appropriate for SaaS usage as it does not allow distribution.  An Appliance license option, which **does** allow you to distribute them, is available.  Email [info&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:info&#64;rootedwest.com) to request an appliance license.

### Can you transfer a license?

Licenses are **not** transferrable to another company.  We will transfer the license from a user-specific email to a group email address (e.g. alice@example.com -> admin@example.com) but only for **the same domain**.  It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address.

### What does the license require me to do?

Your purchase gets you unique access credentials for downloading the gem.  The license agreement requires you to keep these access credentials private.  If we find your access credentials are ever publicized:

1. We'll send you a warning email with details.  You need to remove the content and send a new email address so we can generate new credentials for you.  The old credentials will stop working immediately so you'll need to update your apps.
2. If your credentials are publicized a second time, we reserve the right to permanently remove access (but won't unless it's really egregious - sloppy contractors happen).

### Do I have to share the credentials with all of my developers?

In general, yes. The credentials are required to download the gems and your developers will need the gems to use the commercial features. You can use [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to load the unencrypted credentials in `.env` into each process. Email [support&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:support&#64;rootedwest.com) for additional help/options.

### Can I use Mxdb in an Open Source app?

Not really. In general, everyone running the app would need to purchase their own license and that's generally not going to work.

### Can I get a refund?

Yes, up to two weeks after purchase.  Let us know the reason and maybe we can help but either way it's not a problem.  Email [support&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:support&#64;rootedwest.com).

### How do I update my info?

Email [support&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:support&#64;rootedwest.com).

## Can I request a change to the license terms?

Mxdb is sold as is, no change to terms.  However, email your concerns to [support&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:support&#64;rootedwest.com) and we can negotiate something.

## Can I pay via invoice and purchase order?

Mxdb is credit card only by default. Email [support&#64;rootedwest.com](mailto:support&#64;rootedwest.com) to request additional purchase options.
